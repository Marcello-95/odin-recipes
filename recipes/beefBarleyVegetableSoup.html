    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a slow cooker, cook chuck roast until very tender 
                (usually 4 to 5 hours on High, but can vary with different slow cookers). 
                Add barley and bay leaf during the last hour of cooking. Remove meat, and 
                chop into bite-size pieces. Discard bay leaf. Set beef, broth, and barley 
                aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Saute carrots, celery, 
                onion, and frozen mixed vegetables until tender. Add water, beef bouillon 
                cubes, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, chopped stewed tomatoes, and beef/barley 
                mixture. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 to 20 minutes. Season with 
                additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
